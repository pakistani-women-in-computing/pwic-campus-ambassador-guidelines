# Definition of the Campus Ambassador Program

The PWiC Campus Ambassador Program is designed to increase participation, recruit future team members and expand our network and visibility. PWiC Campus Ambassadors are individuals who propagate the PWiC core values of learning, connecting and growing within their own community. 

This year, the Ambassador program has been expanded to include a Campus Lead position and sub-program as well. 

The PWiC Campus Lead Program is designed to train ambassadors who are interested in leadership. Campus Leads will be selected from the current Campus Ambassador cohort and will have an additional focus on developing their leadership and other soft skills throughout the year. 

As a Campus Ambassador or Lead, you will use your passion for technology and your drive to create an impact. PWiC is a young but rapidly-growing organization and you can play a crucial role in shaping its future. 


# PWiC Campus Ambassador Guidelines

## Why do we need these guidelines?

Here are some of the reasons we need this handbook:

2. We take help from existing communities and material wherever we can (without reinventing the wheel every time) - for operations, organization etc
3. We are aligned in the overall direction and vision when it comes to appointing our campus ambassadors - with small deviances in how we operate locally given the social dynamics of the locality
